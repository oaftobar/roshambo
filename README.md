# Roshambo (Rock Paper Scissors)

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python.

This project was a "What if..." in my head, so I gave myself 30min to get it out.
First pass was a bit ugly so I spent a bit more time reworking the BEATS + decide_winner components to clean it up.

## Current State
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Player vs computer
- Best-of-three gameplay

## Planned Improvements
- [ ] Refactor game logic into modules
- [ ] Add basic unit tests
- [ ] Build a Tkinter GUI
- [ ] Improve input validation
- [ ] Package as a desktop app (macOS)

## Why This Repo Exists
This repo is intentionally iterative. 
The goal is to grow it over time and get familiar with app development.
